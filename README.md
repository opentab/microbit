# BBC micro:bit collection

This repo is for putting together small BBC micro:bit programmes, mostly written in JavaScript.

## Code Kingdom Compilation

The Code Kingdom IDE takes a subset of Javascript and compiles it into runnable assembly for the micro:bit to execute. This however means that Javascript developers expecting certin functionality will discover they do not exist. An incomplete list of such functionality can be found below.

- function parameters
- return keyword
- setTimeout / setInterval functions.
- loops except for 'while'
- arrays

List is incomplete.
